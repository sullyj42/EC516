\section{Real Valued Signal}
Suppose	 $x(t)$ is	a	 real-valued	speech-signal	whose	Fourier	 transform	is	 $X ( j\omega)$ and	it	is	 known	 that	$| X ( j\omega)|= 0$ for	$|\omega | \geq 10,000\pi|$ .	 Let	 $x[n] = x(nT )$ where	 T	 represents	the	 sampling	 interval.	 Answer	 the	 following	 questions	 about	 $X (e^{j\omega}) )$ ,	 the	 DTFT	 of	 x[n],	for	the	specified	values	of	T.\\[0.1in]
First, since the signal is real-valued, I belive the FT should be symmetric about zero (no information in negatives). Though this does not matter for the problem. \\[0.1in]
The following questions all essentially ask where the frequency content is definitely zero, given the band-limiting conditions above. Note that, when sampled, the DFT repeats every $2\pi/T$. The response then becomes "compressed" in frequency.

\subsection{Zeros}
\subsubsection{T = 0.0001 seconds}	
With this sample rate, we have replication occur at $2\pi / 1E-4$. Setting this symmetric about zero, we have a signal repeating on the interval [$-\pi E4, \pi E4].$ This is exactly equal to our band-limiting condition. Thus the only guaranteed zeros occur at $\pi E4*(2k - 1), k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\subsubsection{T = T1/2}

Similar to problem 1, but our band now becomes limited at $2\pi / 5E-5,$ or four times the band limiting rate. Effectively doubling the bandwidth from the last question. The bandwidth is zero at the specified value, 10,000$\pi$. The function folds at $2\pi E4*(2k - 1)$. Thus we have zeros in all regions, [10,000$\pi k$, $2\pi E4*(2k - 1) + 10,000\pi$.

\subsubsection{T1/10}
Using the same process as above, we have zeros between [10,000$\pi k$, $2\pi E4*(2k - 1) + 10,000\pi$.

\subsection{Magnitude of Fourier Transform}
\begin{align*}
 \delta[n-3]  &\to |e^{3j\omega}| = 1.\\
\delta[n-3]  + \delta[n+3] &\to |e^{3j\omega} e^{-3j\omega}| = 2\cos(3\omega).\\
u[n] - u[n-4] \text{(five sample box) } &\to \frac{\sin(4\omega/2)}{ \sin(\omega/2))}e^{-j\omega \cdot 3/2} 
\end{align*}

\subsection{Phase of DTFT}
First, construct the full signal. Note the convolution of a box with a box should be a triangle (potentially with its head cut off). $\Sigma  conv(x[n], x[n-4]) = \Sigma ((u[n] - u[n-4])e^{-j\omega})$
